# Experimenting-with-transfer-learning
In this case study, you will apply transfer learning with two popular networks AlexNet and VGG16 to classify images on CIFAR10 dataset. Starting with weights obtained by pre-training the networks on the imagenet dataset (see Exp. 8), apply transfer learning by training on the CIFAR10 for 3 epochs with batch size 32
